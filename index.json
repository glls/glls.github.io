It operates by performing sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Modern computers can store, retrieve, and process data, typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program.\nHere’s a more detailed breakdown:\nStorage: Computers can store vast amounts of data and make it readily accessible. Processing: They can process data at incredibly high speeds, performing complex calculations and tasks. Output: After processing, computers can produce output that humans can interpret, such as visual display on a monitor, printed pages, audio, etc. Programmable: Perhaps most importantly, computers are programmable, meaning they can execute a set of instructions, or a program, to perform specific tasks. The term “computer” was originally given to humans who performed numerical calculations using mechanical calculators. However, today’s computers are electronic devices that accept data (input), process that data, produce output, and then store the results (storage).\nComputers have evolved significantly since their inception, from the early mechanical devices to today’s sophisticated electronic machines that find applications in virtually every aspect of modern life.\nOS An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware, providing a user-friendly environment for running programs. Here are some key points about operating systems:\nHardware Management:\nThe OS interfaces with the computer’s hardware, handling input and output devices (such as keyboards, mice, Wi-Fi radios, storage devices, and displays). It communicates with device drivers (provided by hardware creators) to manage these devices. Software Services:\nOperating systems include common system services, libraries, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers use to write programs. When an application wants to perform a task (e.g., printing), it hands it off to the OS, which handles the details (e.g., sending instructions to the printer). Multi-Tasking and Resource Allocation:\nOSs manage multi-tasking, allocating hardware resources among multiple running programs. They control which processes run, allocate memory between applications, and allow parallel execution on multi-core CPUs. File and Resource Access:\nThe OS controls access to files and other resources for programs. Most software applications are written for specific operating systems, which handle low-level hardware instructions. In summary, the operating system is the core software that manages all hardware and software interactions on a computer, ensuring efficient resource utilization and providing essential services for applications.\nProgramming Languages A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs. Let’s break down what this means:\nSyntax and Semantics:\nSyntax: Programming languages have a specific set of rules (syntax) that dictate how code should be structured. These rules define how to write statements, expressions, and other constructs. Semantics: Beyond syntax, programming languages also have semantics, which determine the meaning of code. Semantics describe how the program behaves when executed. Features:\nType System: Programming languages provide a way to define data types (e.g., integers, strings, arrays) and enforce type safety. Variables: They allow you to store and manipulate data during program execution. Error Handling: Languages include mechanisms to handle errors gracefully. Control Flow: You can create loops, conditionals, and other control structures. Functions/Methods: These allow you to encapsulate reusable code. Libraries: Languages come with built-in libraries or allow you to import external ones. Implementation:\nAn implementation of a programming language (such as a compiler or interpreter) translates human-readable code into machine-executable instructions. The goal is to make the computer understand and execute the instructions provided by the programmer. Low-Level vs. High-Level:\nLow-level languages (closer to machine code) offer precise control but are harder to read. High-level languages (closer to human communication) are easier to program in and translate into machine code. Abstraction:\nOver time, programming languages have become more abstract, hiding hardware details for simplicity. Thousands of languages exist, each designed for specific purposes (imperative, functional, logic, or object-oriented). Remember, when you write code, you’re essentially giving instructions to the computer using a programming language. Whether you’re creating web applications, analyzing data, or building games, programming languages are your tools for communicating with computers! 🚀\nFrameworks A framework in programming is like a sturdy structure that provides a solid base for …","date":1715180696,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715180696,"objectID":"505f1926928104c1ffdf04557ad3e744","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/programming/","publishdate":"2024-05-08T18:04:56+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/programming/","section":"post","summary":"Computers A computer is an electronic device that can be programmed to carry out a wide range of tasks.

Today, we’ll explore its power for image and video conversions, giving you more control over your media files for future reference or projects.\nImage Manipulation Animated GIFs are a fun way to add life to your content. Here’s how to manipulate them with ImageMagick’s convert command:\nLooping GIFs: Ever wanted a GIF to play endlessly? Use this command\nconvert -delay 20 -loop 0 nonloopingImage.gif loopingImage.gif This creates a looping version of nonloopingImage.gif with a delay of 20 milliseconds between frames. Adjust the delay for faster or slower playback. The -loop 0 sets unlimited loops.\nCreating GIFs with Transparency: Want a GIF with clear backgrounds? Here’s the command\nconvert -delay 100 -loop 0 -dispose previous *.png hands.gif This command combines all PNG files in the current directory (replace *.png with specific filenames if needed) into a GIF named hands.gif. The -delay 100 sets a delay of 100 milliseconds, -loop 0 enables infinite looping, and -dispose previous ensures transparency in the final GIF.\nSVG to PNG Conversion Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are perfect for logos and icons, but sometimes you need a PNG image. Here’s how to convert SVG to PNG using rsvg-convert\nrsvg-convert -h 32 icon.svg \u0026gt; icon-32.png This command converts icon.svg to a PNG named icon-32.png with a height of 32 pixels. Replace 32 with your desired pixel height or width for a specific aspect ratio.\nAudio Manipulation Generate audio from console Play a sine wave at 234Hz for 5 seconds using the play command:\nplay -n synth 5 sin 234 hz Here’s a breakdown of the options used:\n-n This option tells play to play the sound only once (for 5 seconds in this case). synth This specifies that we want to generate a synthesized sound. 5 This is the duration in seconds for which the sound will be played. sin This keyword tells play to generate a sine wave. 234 hz This defines the frequency of the sine wave as 234 Hertz. Make sure you have the play command from SoX installed on your system for this to work.\nVideo Manipulation Extract a video segment from a larger video file using ffmpeg fmpeg -i Untitled.mp3 -t 00:00:09 -acodec copy output.mp3 Let’s break down what the command above does:\n-i: This option specifies the input file. In your case, it’s Untitled.mp3. -t 00:00:09: This option sets the output duration to 9 seconds. Here, 00 represents hours and minutes (which are zero in this case). -acodec copy: This option tells ffmpeg to copy the audio stream from the input file without re-encoding it. This is efficient if you don’t need to modify the audio quality. output.mp3: This specifies the name of the output file, which will be a 9-second clip of your original MP3. Overall, this command extracts a 9-second segment from your Untitled.mp3 file and saves it as output.mp3 while preserving the original audio quality.\nDownloading Videos youtube-dl works on OS X, Linux and Windows, and can download videos in any format YouTube provides.\nVideo DownloadHelper is a Firefox/Chrome extension for downloading videos from many sites with minimum effort.\nPlaying a video stream from the command line with mpv mpv --cache-on-disk stream_93b9d36741fe2f46.m3u Check the official page for more info https://mpv.io/\n","date":1710200422,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710200422,"objectID":"07ef6c14327d7b1e3ed97ab9e8fd5b97","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/image-video-cheatsheet/","publishdate":"2024-03-12T02:40:22+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/image-video-cheatsheet/","section":"post","summary":"This page is work in progress, eventually more examples will be added.\nThe command line might seem intimidating, but it offers hidden gems for everyday tasks.

Whether you’re a seasoned system administrator or just starting to explore the command line, having a solid grasp of SSH commands is essential. This cheatsheet provides a quick reference for the most commonly used SSH operations.\nConnecting to a Server The basic syntax for connecting to a server with SSH is:\nssh username@server_address [-p port_number] username: Your username on the remote server. server_address: The IP address or hostname of the server. port_number: The port number used by the SSH server. Password vs. Key-Based Authentication You can connect to a server using a password or a public/private key pair. Key-based authentication is generally considered more secure as it eliminates the need to transmit passwords over the network.\nBasic File Transfer scp (Secure Copy): Used to securely copy files between your local machine and the remote server.\nTo copy a file from the remote server to your local machine: scp username@server_address:/path/to/file local_destination To copy a file from your local machine to the remote server: scp local_file username@server_address:/path/to/destination Remote Commands You can execute commands on the remote server directly from your local terminal:\nssh username@server_address \u0026#39;command_to_execute\u0026#39; command_to_execute: The command you want to run on the remote server. Understanding the .ssh Directory The hidden directory ~/.ssh (on Unix-based systems) stores SSH configuration files specific to your user account. It’s typically not created by default, but SSH will create it if it’s missing when you first use a key-based authentication or configure the client. Common files you might find in this directory include:\nid_rsa (private key): This file contains your private SSH key, used for key-based authentication. It should be kept secret and have strict permissions to prevent unauthorized access. id_rsa.pub (public key): This public key file corresponds to your private key and can be added to authorized keys on servers you want to connect to. config (SSH configuration file): This file allows you to define connection options for specific servers or set global defaults for SSH. Exploring the SSH Config File The config file within the .ssh directory is a powerful tool for customizing SSH connections. It uses a simple format with options and arguments to define settings. Here are some common uses:\nHost definitions: You can create sections for specific servers (identified by hostname or IP address) and define options for those connections, such as port, username, and IdentityFile (path to your private key). Global options: You can set default settings for all SSH connections, like preferred encryption ciphers or preferred authentication methods. Aliases: You can define aliases for servers to simplify connection commands. For example, you could create an alias for a server with a long hostname to make connecting easier. SSH Tunneling SSH tunneling, also known as SSH port forwarding, is a powerful feature that allows you to create secure connections between your local machine and a remote server. It essentially creates an encrypted tunnel through which you can forward traffic between different ports. This can be useful for various purposes, such as:\nSecurely accessing remote services: If a server offers a service on a non-standard port (for example, a web server on port 8080 instead of the usual port 80), you can use SSH tunneling to securely access it as if it were running on the standard port on your local machine. Tunneling traffic through firewalls: Firewalls might restrict access to certain ports. By tunneling traffic through an SSH connection, you can bypass these restrictions and access the desired service. (Note: This should only be done with proper authorization and caution) Creating SOCKS proxies: SSH tunnels can be configured to function as SOCKS proxies, allowing you to route all your internet traffic through the secure SSH connection. There are two main types of SSH tunneling:\nLocal Port Forwarding: This forwards traffic from a specific port on your local machine to a port on the remote server. Here’s an example:\nLet’s say you want to securely access a web server running on port 8080 on a remote server. You can use local port forwarding to map port 8080 on the remote server to a different port (e.g., port 8000) on your local machine. By accessing http://localhost:8000 in your web browser, the traffic will be securely tunneled through the SSH connection and reach the web server on the remote machine.\nThe command for this scenario would be:\nssh -L 8000:localhost:8080 username@server_address -L: Flag for local port forwarding. 8000: Local port on your machine where you want to access the service. localhost:8080: The destination on the remote server (localhost refers to the remote server itself in this case). username: Your username on the remote server. server_address: The …","date":1707717782,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707717782,"objectID":"ea844e2cefb94a8f0a2322ac6ff726d5","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/ssh-cheatsheet/","publishdate":"2024-02-12T09:03:02+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/ssh-cheatsheet/","section":"post","summary":"SSH, or Secure Shell, is a fundamental tool for securely connecting to and managing remote servers.

It’s a powerful and widely-used language specifically designed for managing data stored in relational databases.\nThere are several situations where using SQL directly might be preferable to using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)\nPerformance Complex Queries: While ORMs simplify complex queries, they often translate them into multiple underlying SQL statements. For very intricate queries, writing raw SQL can give you more control and potentially improve performance. Database-Specific Features: ORMs sometimes have limitations when dealing with functionalities specific to a particular database engine. If you need to leverage advanced features offered by your database (like stored procedures or custom functions), using raw SQL allows you to interact with them directly. Customization and Control Fine-Tuning Queries: SQL grants you complete control over the query structure. You can optimize queries for specific use cases and databases, something that might be limited with an ORM’s abstraction layer. Database Schema Changes: If your database schema undergoes frequent modifications, relying solely on an ORM might require frequent updates to your object mappings. With SQL, you can directly adapt your queries to the evolving schema. Troubleshooting Error Diagnostics: When errors occur with ORM-generated queries, it can be challenging to pinpoint the exact cause. With raw SQL, you can directly see the query being executed, making it easier to diagnose and fix issues. Understanding Database Behavior: For developers who want a deeper understanding of how the database interprets and executes queries, using SQL provides greater transparency into the underlying processes. Basics Here are the basic SQL commands that form the foundation for interacting with relational databases:\nSELECT: This is the most fundamental command used to retrieve data from a database table. You can specify the columns (fields) you want to retrieve and optionally use a WHERE clause to filter the results based on certain conditions. Here’s an example: SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE country = \u0026#39;GR\u0026#39;; This query selects the name and email columns from the users table, but only for users where the country is ‘GR’.\nINSERT: This command allows you to insert new data into a table. You specify the table name and the values you want to insert for each column. Here’s an example:\nINSERT INTO products (name, price, category) VALUES (\u0026#39;shirt\u0026#39;, 9.99, \u0026#39;clothing\u0026#39;); This query inserts a new row into the products table with the following details:\nname: shirt price: 9.99 category: clothing UPDATE: This command is used to modify existing data in a table. You specify the table name, the changes you want to make, and a WHERE clause to target specific rows for the update. Here’s an example:\nUPDATE customers SET email = \u0026#39;new_email@example.com\u0026#39; WHERE id = 10; This query updates the email address for the customer with id equal to 10 in the customers table.\nDELETE: This command allows you to remove rows from a table. Similar to UPDATE, you can use a WHERE clause to filter the rows you want to delete. Here’s an example:\nDELETE FROM orders WHERE status = \u0026#39;completed\u0026#39; AND order_date \u0026lt; \u0026#39;2024-01-01\u0026#39;; This query deletes all orders from the orders table that are marked as “completed” and have an order date before January 1st, 2024.\nThese are just a few basic SQL commands to get you started. As you learn more, you’ll discover commands for more complex tasks like joining data from multiple tables, grouping results, and using aggregate functions.\nCheck these official documentation resources for more in-depth information on SQL:\nPostgreSQL Documentation\nMySQL 8.0 Reference Manual\nSQLite Documentation\nJOINs JOINs are a fundamental concept in relational databases that allow you to combine data from multiple tables based on a shared field. They are essential for retrieving related information across different tables.\nHere’s a breakdown of the basics about JOINs:\nPurpose: JOINs enable you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query, establishing relationships between them. This eliminates the need to write separate queries and then manually combine the results. Types of JOINs: There are several types of JOINs, each serving a specific purpose: Inner JOIN: This retrieves records that exist in both tables based on the matching criteria. It’s the most common type of JOIN. Left JOIN: This includes all records from the left table (the table mentioned first in the JOIN clause) and matching records from the right table. Records from the right table with no match will have NULL values in the corresponding columns. Right JOIN: Similar to Left JOIN, but includes all records from the right table and matching records from the left table. Full JOIN: This combines all records from both tables, including those with no match in the other table (represented by NULL values). Example: Imagine you have two tables:\nCustomers: Contains customer information …","date":1700151813,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700151813,"objectID":"520fecc1ac819227ae555cc231765f43","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/sql-cheatsheet/","publishdate":"2023-11-16T19:23:33+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/sql-cheatsheet/","section":"post","summary":"SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

Git, a distributed version control system (DVCS), has become the industry standard for developers of all backgrounds.\nGit Configuration The initial setup of Git involves configuring your user information and some helpful settings.\nCommand Description git config --global user.name \u0026#34;[Your Name]\u0026#34; Sets the name associated with your commits and tags. Replace [Your Name] with your actual first and last name. git config --global user.email \u0026#34;[your-valid-email@example.com]\u0026#34; Sets the email address associated with your commits and tags. Replace [your-valid-email@example.com] with your actual email address. git config --global color.ui auto Enables automatic colorization of Git’s command-line output for better readability. Starting a Project / INIT Git provides two primary ways to begin working with a project: creating a new local repository or cloning an existing one.\nCommand Description git init [project name] (optional) Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. If you provide a [project name], Git will create a new directory with that name and initialize a repository inside it. git clone \u0026lt;project URL\u0026gt; Downloads a complete project, including its entire history, from a remote repository specified by the \u0026lt;project URL\u0026gt;. Day-to-Day Work / Stage \u0026amp; Snapshot Essential Git commands for your daily workflow:\nCommand Description git status Displays the current state of your working directory, including new, modified, and staged files. It also shows the current branch name, commit identifier, and any changes awaiting commit. git add [file] Adds a specific file to the staging area, which prepares it for the next commit. Use . (dot) to add all changed files from the current directory and its subdirectories. git diff [file] (optional) Shows the differences between the working directory (your uncommitted changes) and the staging area, allowing you to review modifications before committing. git diff --staged [file] (optional) Reveals changes between the staging area (files prepared for commit) and the last committed snapshot, helping you verify staged modifications. git checkout -- [file] (Use with caution! ) Discards all changes made to a specific file in the working directory. This action cannot be undone! git reset [\u0026lt;path\u0026gt;] Reverts changes in the working directory or staging area to match the specified path or the latest commit (HEAD). Use cautiously, as it can lose unsaved work. git commit -m \u0026#34;[descriptive message]\u0026#34; Creates a new commit snapshot, capturing the current state of the staged files. Include a clear and concise message describing the changes made. git rm [file] Removes a file from both the working directory and the staging area, effectively deleting it from your project. Git Stash Commands Command Description git stash Temporarily saves the current state of your working directory (uncommitted changes and staged files) for later use. This creates a “stash” entry, essentially a snapshot of your current work. git stash list Lists all your stashed changes in reverse chronological order (most recent stash at the top). This helps you identify and manage specific stashed modifications. git stash pop Applies the changes from the most recent stash (top of the stash list) to your working directory. This effectively “un-stashes” your work, incorporating the previously saved changes. The stash itself is removed after a successful pop. git stash drop Permanently removes a specific stash entry from the stash list. Use the output from git stash list to identify the stash you want to delete (e.g., git stash drop stash@{0} to delete the most recent stash). Use with caution! Once dropped, a stash cannot be recovered. Git Branching Model / Branch \u0026amp; Merge / Rewrite History Effective branching strategies are essential for managing code development in Git. Here’s a breakdown of key Git commands for branching, merging, and history manipulation:\nCommand Description git branch [-a] Lists all local branches in your repository. Use the -a flag to see both local and remote branches. git branch [branch_name] Creates a new branch named [branch_name] that starts from the current HEAD commit. git rebase [branch] (Use with caution! ) Rebases the current branch on top of the specified [branch]. This replays your commits on top of the [branch] history, potentially rewriting history and making it difficult for collaboration. Consider using git merge for collaborative workflows. git checkout [-b] [branch_name] Switches your working directory to the specified [branch_name]. Use the -b flag to create a new branch named [branch_name] if it doesn’t exist yet. git merge [branch_name] Merges the changes from the specified [branch_name] into the current branch, combining their histories. This is generally preferred over git rebase for collaborative development. git branch -d [branch_name] Deletes the specified [branch_name], but only if it has …","date":1696921200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696921200,"objectID":"49fecb387c4b9fa8927f69c12b745898","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/git-cheatsheet/","publishdate":"2023-10-10T10:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/git-cheatsheet/","section":"post","summary":"In today’s collaborative development world, version control is crucial for managing code effectively.

But how do you know it can handle the traffic you expect? Benchmarking is the answer! It allows you to simulate real-world load and measure your server’s performance. This post will guide you through using wrk, a powerful tool for benchmarking your web server.\nwrk is a fast, user-friendly HTTP benchmarking tool. It’s lightweight and easy to install. Once you have wrk set up, you can start crafting your benchmark test. wrk offers various options to configure your test precisely. You can define the number of threads to simulate concurrent users, the number of connections per thread, and the test duration. wrk also allows you to specify headers to be sent with each request, mimicking real user behavior.\nRunning a wrk test is straightforward. You provide the URL you want to benchmark along with the desired configuration options. Wrks then bombards your server with simulated traffic, measuring critical metrics like request latency, throughput, and overall system health. After the test concludes, wrk presents a detailed report. This report showcases valuable data points like average request time, request rate, and connection errors. Analyzing this data helps you identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in your web server’s performance.\nBy incorporating wrk into your routine, you gain valuable insights into your web server’s capabilities. This allows you to optimize your server’s configuration, ensuring it can handle peak traffic and deliver a seamless user experience.\nHere’s an excerpt from the wrk project’s README on GitHub for quick reference:\nBasic Usage wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html This runs a benchmark for 30 seconds, using 12 threads, and keeping 400 HTTP connections open.\nOutput:\nRunning 30s test @ http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html 12 threads and 400 connections Thread Stats Avg Stdev Max +/- Stdev Latency 635.91us 0.89ms 12.92ms 93.69% Req/Sec 56.20k 8.07k 62.00k 86.54% 22464657 requests in 30.00s, 17.76GB read Requests/sec: 748868.53 Transfer/sec: 606.33MB Command Line Options -c, --connections: total number of HTTP connections to keep open with each thread handling N = connections/threads -d, --duration: duration of the test, e.g. 2s, 2m, 2h -t, --threads: total number of threads to use -s, --script: LuaJIT script, see SCRIPTING -H, --header: HTTP header to add to request, e.g. \u0026#34;User-Agent: wrk\u0026#34; --latency: print detailed latency statistics --timeout: record a timeout if a response is not received within this amount of time. Benchmarking Tips The machine running wrk must have a sufficient number of ephemeral ports available and closed sockets should be recycled quickly. To handle the initial connection burst the server’s listen(2) backlog should be greater than the number of concurrent connections being tested.\nA user script that only changes the HTTP method, path, adds headers or a body, will have no performance impact. Per-request actions, particularly building a new HTTP request, and use of response() will necessarily reduce the amount of load that can be generated.\n","date":1694358000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694358000,"objectID":"5479a4a6cccd6940738a5f17d336d390","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/benchmark-webserver/","publishdate":"2023-09-10T18:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/benchmark-webserver/","section":"post","summary":"Keeping your web server running smoothly is crucial for a positive user experience.

With its dual-pane interface and a range of features, MC simplifies file and directory operations, making it a beloved tool for both beginners and experienced users. As stated on it’s GitHub page, GNU Midnight Commander was conceived as a free clone of John Socha’s Norton Commander™. It also takes the best from more recent software with similar interfaces. Many years ago, we used file-managers like these, as “Norton Commander” in DOS, or the legendary DiskMaster2 in AmigaDOS, which is still alive in aminet!\nDual-Pane Interface for Seamless File Management One of the key strengths of Midnight Commander is its intuitive dual-pane layout. The two panes allow users to navigate through directories and manipulate files seamlessly. Whether you’re copying, moving, or deleting files, the dual-pane view enables quick and effortless operations. Moreover, MC provides a command-line prompt at the bottom, allowing users to execute commands directly without switching to a separate terminal window. This combination of a visual interface and command-line capabilities enhances productivity and workflow efficiency.\nFeature-Rich Functionality In addition to its exceptional file management capabilities, MC offers a wide range of features that further enhance its usefulness. It includes a built-in file viewer, which allows users to examine the contents of various file types without the need for external applications. Additionally, MC features a powerful text editor, enabling users to make quick modifications to files without leaving the application. The integrated FTP client functionality allows seamless transfers of files between local and remote systems, adding another layer of convenience for users who need to work with remote servers.\nYou can install MC in different systems or you can compile it from source (it’s written in C).\nMacOS brew install mc Ubuntu/Debian sudo apt install mc Archlinux sudo pacman -S mc Here’s a list of feature copied directly from GitHub:\nFeatures Some features are specific to the POSIX environment MC runs on, some are familiar to the users of similar software for other operating systems. The features include:\nBuilt in Virtual File System: manipulate remote file systems through the FTP and SFTP protocols or over secure shell, browse contents of tar, ar, rpm, zip, cpio, lha and rar archives just like local files.\nAlmost all operations work with the virtual file system, enabling you to do complex tasks, like viewing files in archives on an FTP server.\nMouse support on most terminal emulators for X Window System as well as on the Linux console.\nLearn Keys: GNU Midnight Commander may be configured at run time to support any kind of input keys for a given terminal, making its operation possible even on most weird terminals.\nText and hex editors are available for you to use (hex editor is a part of the viewer).\nHotlist allows you to keep a list of common visited locations, including remote sites and directories inside archives.\nCommand completion: By pressing Alt-Tab in any place where a filename or an executable are expected, GNU Midnight Commander will complete the name for you. If you press Alt-Tab for the second time, you get a list box with all possible completions.\nSubshell support: Run your commands by a real shell interpreter. GNU Midnight Commander interacts with bash, tcsh and zsh to provide you with all of the facilities available in your preferred shell.\nFind file command can search for the file contents.\nBackground operations allow you to copy or move files from any virtual file system while you do other tasks (i.e., you can do background FTP copies).\nFTP proxy is supported.\nLinux file recovery: If you are using Linux, you can recover deleted files from an ext2 or ext3 partition with the undelete file system. This is a low level file recovery function that can recover files deleted by any program on Linux.\nExternal panelization: You can run any arbitrary external command and GNU Midnight Commander will display the output generated as a file listing that can be manipulated as a regular directory.\nEmacs-like key bindings are used in all widgets.\nContext dependent actions (open, view, edit) are available.\nThe built-in file viewer, together with the context dependent actions is used to format man pages on the fly, coloring mail messages and more.\nThe built-in editor supports syntax highlighting and external actions, such as spell checking and formatting.\n","date":1685945887,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685945887,"objectID":"4cd8c9228b146b7addbbcef2c23463f1","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/mc/","publishdate":"2023-06-05T09:18:07+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/mc/","section":"post","summary":"In the world of command-line interfaces, Midnight Commander (MC) stands out as a powerful and versatile file manager that brings efficiency and convenience to text-based terminals","tags":["file manager","open source","productivity","tools"],"title":"MC: a commander like no other","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"scrcpy is an open-source tool developed by Genymobile, you can visit the Official GitHub and learn more.\nWord from the author: This application mirrors Android devices (video and audio) connected via USB or over TCP/IP, and allows to control the device with the keyboard and the mouse of the computer.

Pre-commit hooks and pre-push hooks are scripts that run before a commit or a push, and they are used to perform automated tests, code quality checks, or other actions that help ensure the quality and correctness of your code. You can use husky or pre-commit if you need extra features or just production ready tools.\nSometimes, you may need to bypass these hooks and push your changes without running them. For example, if you’re in a hurry and you need to push a critical bug fix, or if you’re working in a team with strict code review policies and you need to push a work-in-progress commit for collaboration purposes.\nTo use it simply add the --no-verify flag to your git push command:\ngit push --no-verify This will push your changes to the remote repository without running the pre-commit or pre-push hooks.\nHowever, it’s important to note that using –no-verify should be done with caution, as it can potentially lead to lower code quality and a higher risk of introducing bugs or other issues into your codebase. Therefore, it’s recommended to only use –no-verify when it’s absolutely necessary and always double-check your code before pushing it to a remote repository.\nYou can check the official Git Documentation.\nIf you want a refresher on general Git practices you can check my presentation.\n","date":1678272172,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678272172,"objectID":"20d1a761eaf28602b22658847a96f7c5","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/git-bypass/","publishdate":"2023-03-08T12:42:52+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/git-bypass/","section":"post","summary":"git push --no-verify is a command used to push your local changes to a remote repository without running pre-commit hooks or pre-push hooks.

This allows users to move their cursor and type on one computer while the keyboard and mouse inputs are sent to another computer.\nBarrier also supports the use of multiple monitors, allowing users to move their cursor seamlessly between different screens.The software is designed to be simple, easy to use, and highly configurable. Barrier is available for many operating systems and can be downloaded from GitHub.\nA little bit of history:\nBarrier was created as a fork of Synergy due to certain limitations and issues that the developer of Barrier, Debauchee, experienced while using Synergy. Due to these limitations and issues, Debauchee decided to create a fork of Synergy, called Barrier, with the goal of addressing these issues and providing a more stable, customizable, and actively developed alternative to Synergy. Some of the features that Barrier added that Synergy didn’t have at the time like multi-monitor support, encryption, and improved cursor handling. Since then, Barrier has continued to be developed and maintained, with new features and improvements being added on a regular basis. It is also actively supported by its developer community, which aims to provide a stable, customizable and actively developed KVM solution for those who need it.\nI was an early user and even an Early Adopter of Synergy but was disappointed by the changes and bugs in version 3, then I switched to Barrier and never looked back.\nThe official Raspberry Pi website praised Barrier with a nice article and a video guide.\nThe configuration is easy and straightforward. You can find the instructions on how to install and configure Barrier on the GitHub page or watch the video.\nTip: You can use Scroll Lock to lock on a computer and don’t switch by accident to another, e.g. when playing a game.\n","date":1674230400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674230400,"objectID":"7818b3440a5d0a96355cd5c8d8afee4b","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/barrier/","publishdate":"2023-01-20T19:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/barrier/","section":"post","summary":"Barrier is an open-source KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) software that allows users to share their keyboard and mouse across multiple computers.

Do you want to know how fast your local network is? Would you like to compare your WiFi and ethernet speeds? Do you want to check for faulty cables? You can do all of the above, and more, with iperf3.\nAs the devolpers state at the official website :\nThe iperf series of tools perform active measurements to determine the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, protocols, and buffers. For each test it reports the measured throughput, loss, and other parameters.\niperf3 is a powerful tool that can be used to benchmark the performance of local network computers. It allows you to measure the bandwidth and latency of a network connection between two devices. This can be useful for identifying bottlenecks and troubleshooting network issues.\nTo use iperf3, you will need to have it installed on both the client and server computers. Once installed, you can run the following commands to start the benchmarking process.\nOn the server computer, open a command prompt and type “iperf3 -s”. This will start the iperf3 server and listen for incoming connections.\nOn the client computer, open a command prompt and type “iperf3 -c [server IP]”. Replace [server IP] with the IP address of the server computer. This will connect the client to the server and begin the benchmarking process.\nBy default, iperf3 will perform a test for 10 seconds and provide the results in a summary. However, you can specify a longer test duration or change other settings using command line options. For example, you can use the -t option to specify the test duration in seconds, and the -w option to specify the TCP window size.\nOnce the test is complete, you will see the results displayed on the client computer. These results will include the bandwidth and latency of the connection, as well as any errors that occurred during the test.\nIn addition to the basic test, iperf3 also supports various advanced options such as parallel streams, bidirectional tests, and more. It is a great tool for network administrators and developers to check the performance of their network.\nIn conclusion, iperf3 is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for benchmarking the performance of local network computers. It allows you to measure the bandwidth and latency of a network connection, and provides detailed results that can be used to identify and troubleshoot network issues.\nFirst, install iperf3 for your operating system, do that in every computer you want to benchmark.\nArchlinux sudo pacman -S iperf3 macOS brew install iperf3 Ubuntu/Debian apt get install iperf3 Windows scoop install iperf3 Synology NAS Install SynoCli Monitor Tools from the SynoCommunity website\nReal-life tests We will use the Synology NAS as the server and run tests across some local machines acting as clients.

Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. a bit of history cont’d\nAs with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.\nGit is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license. Tech Talk Linus Torvalds on git Git is alive\nDecember 12, 2022 Git is alive and actively developed Git Official site\nSO Survey 2021\nStack Overflow Developer Survey 2021 Over 90% of respondents use Git, suggesting that it is a fundamental tool to being a developer.\nSO Survey 2022\nStack Overflow Developer Survey 2022 No other technology is as widely used as Git. Especially among Professional Developers.\nQ: What are the primary version control systems you use?\nGlossary Working directory - repo the working directory is the folder on your system that you want to track. Where you develop your project. Everything git related is inside the .git folder. Serverless. Remote repository Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted elsewhere. You can have several of them, each one is either RO or RW for you. Git files Inside the working directory and beneath, you might find some git related files .gitattributes how to handle files .gitignore what to ignore .gitkeep keep an empty dir Tracked files Tracked files are the files in the working directory (repository) that Git manages. .\nThe Staging Area The intermediary between the working directory and the project history. Commit Commit is the process of adding any changes in tracked files. Git will keep track of all the changes in the Committed History. .\nCommit message The commit message is a summary and description of a commit action. Branches (develop, feature, master) A branch is a set of the repo tracked files. Git allows you to compare and merge branches. It can also be used to organize collaboration inside the repo, fix specific bugs, or create new features. .\nMerge Copy code changes from one branch to another. (not really git)\nFork You clone a public repo, make changes and contribute back with a PR. .\nPull/Merge request (PR) A PR is a request to the repository owner to merge your changes back into the original code base. git init Install git, then\ngit config --global user.name \u0026#34;John Smith\u0026#34; git config --global user.email john@example.com git config --global init.defaultBranch main Create a new folder for your project and add a file under version control\nmkdir -p ~/projects/git-test cd ~/projects/git-test git init nano new_file git add .

To test the utility of TooManyEyes, police ‘super-recognisers’ (SRs) who may possess exceptional face recognition ability, and police controls attempted to identify the target-actors from the SFCT. As expected, SRs correctly identified more target-actors; with higher confidence than controls. As such, the TooManyEyes system provides a useful platform for uploading tests for selecting police or security staff for CCTV review deployment.","tags":["super-recognisers","face recognition","CCTV","face matching"],"title":"TooManyEyes: Super-recogniser directed identification of target individuals on CCTV","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"c43bf438851b323f84fdbdcd6769c016","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/project/typhon/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/typhon/","section":"project","summary":"Interactive video to text converter","tags":["Python","OpenCV","OCR","Tool"],"title":"Typhon","type":"project"},{"authors":["P.Daras","A.Axenopoulos","George Litos"],"categories":["Computer Vision"],"content":"","date":1333238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1333238400,"objectID":"17239f744ce865532a0de224aadb5110","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/publication/3d-object-retrieval/","publishdate":"2019-06-02T22:58:23+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/3d-object-retrieval/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a novel framework for 3-D object retrieval, taking into account most of the factors that may affect the retrieval performance. Initially, a novel 3-D model alignment method is introduced, which achieves accurate rotation estimation through the combination of two intuitive criteria, plane reflection symmetry and rectilinearity. After the pose normalization stage, a low-level descriptor extraction procedure follows, using three different types of descriptors, which have been proven to be effective. Then, a novel combination procedure of the above descriptors takes place, which achieves higher retrieval performance than each descriptor does separately. The paper provides also an in-depth study of the factors that can further improve the 3-D object retrieval accuracy. These include selection of the appropriate dissimilarity metric, feature selection/dimensionality reduction on the initial low-level descriptors, as well as manifold learning for re-ranking of the search results. Experiments performed on two 3-D model benchmark datasets confirm our assumption that future research in 3-D object retrieval should focus more on the efficient combination of low-level descriptors as well as on the selection of the best features and matching metrics, than on the investigation of the optimal 3-D object descriptor.","tags":["3D object retrieval","descriptor extraction","feature selection","manifold learning","rotation estimation"],"title":"Investigating the Effects of Multiple Factors towards more Accurate 3D Object Retrieval","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.Dutagaci","A.Godil","P.Daras","A.Axenopoulos","George Litos","S.Manolopoulou","K.Goto","T.Yanagimachi","Y.Kurita","S.Kawamura","T.Furuya","R.Ohbuchi","B.Gong","J.Liu","X.Tang"],"categories":["Computer Vision"],"content":"","date":1333238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1333238400,"objectID":"f267b29ce66d569e96e8fc5b70eb1b64","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/publication/shrec/","publishdate":"2012-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shrec/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we present the results of the 3D Shape Retrieval Contest 2011 (SHREC'11) track on generic shape retrieval.

Given the extend of the challenges involved in the automatic extraction of such descriptions, manually created metadata play a significant role, further strengthened by their deployment in training and evaluation tasks related to the automatic extraction of content descriptions. The different views taken by the two main approaches towards semantic content description, namely the Semantic Web and MPEG-7, as well as the traits particular to multimedia content due to the multiplicity of information levels involved, have resulted in a variety of image and video annotation tools, adopting varying description aspects. Aiming to provide a common framework of reference and furthermore to highlight open issues, especially with respect to the coverage and the interoperability of the produced metadata, in this chapter we present an overview of the state of the art in image and video annotation tools.","tags":["Annotation Tool","Image Annotation","Semantic Annotation","Video Annotation","Descriptive Metadata"],"title":"A Survey of Semantic Image and Video Annotation Tools","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.Axenopoulos","George Litos","P.Daras"],"categories":["3D Stereo Scene Analysis","Computer Vision"],"content":"","date":1302912000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1302912000,"objectID":"7b1f8ea2b2684e46eba300ab566746ce","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/publication/3d-model-retrieval/","publishdate":"2011-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/3d-model-retrieval/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a novel framework for 3D object retrieval is presented. The paper focuses on the investigation of an accurate D model alignment method, which is achieved by combining two intuitive criteria, the plane reflection symmetry and rectilinearity. After proper positioning in a coordinate system, a set of 2D images (multi-views) are automatically generated from the 3D object, by taking views from uniformly distributed viewpoints. For each image, a set of flip-invariant shape descriptors is extracted. Taking advantage of both the pose estimation of the 3D objects and the flip-invariance property of the extracted descriptors, a new matching scheme for fast computation of 3D object dissimilarity is introduced. Experiments conducted in SHREC 2009 benchmark show the superiority of the pose estimation method over similar approaches, as well as the efficiency of the new matching scheme.","tags":["pose estimation","alignment","3D object retrieval"],"title":"3D Model Retrieval using Accurate Pose Estimation and View-based Similarity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["George Litos","X.Zabulis","G.A.Triantafyllidis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1149120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1149120000,"objectID":"104fec222dde836ba72d5a6279065f25","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/publication/network-synchronization/","publishdate":"2006-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/network-synchronization/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a software-based system for the real-time synchronization of images captured by a low-cost camera framework is presented.

The proposed method utilizes messages to establish a consensus on the time of image acquisition and NTP synchronization of computer clocks. It also provides with an error signal, in case of failure of the synchronization.

This paper focuses on the user interface of the OTELO system, consisting of the following parts: an ultrasound video transmission system providing real-time images of the scanned area, an audio/video conference to communicate with the paramedical assistant and with the patient, and a virtual-reality environment, providing visual and haptic feedback to the expert, while capturing the expert's hand movements. These movements are reproduced by the robot at the patient site while holding the ultrasound probe against the patient skin. In addition, the user interface includes an image processing facility for enhancing the received images and the possibility to include them into a database.","tags":["User interfaces","Ultrasonic imaging","Mobile robots","Medical robotics","Videoconference","Biomedical imaging","Real time systems","Haptic interfaces","Feedback","Probes"],"title":"Mobile Tele-echography: User Interface Design","type":"publication"}]
