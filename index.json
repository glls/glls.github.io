Two of the most popular package managers are Scoop for Windows and Homebrew for macOS.\nScoop Scoop is a command-line installer for Windows that allows users to easily install and manage software packages from the command line. As mentioned in the GitHub official page\nWhat does Scoop do?\nScoop installs programs from the command line with a minimal amount of friction. It:\nEliminates permission popup windows Hides GUI wizard-style installers Prevents PATH pollution from installing lots of programs Avoids unexpected side-effects from installing and uninstalling programs Finds and installs dependencies automatically Performs all the extra setup steps itself to get a working program Scoop is very scriptable, so you can run repeatable setups to get your environment just the way you like, e.g.:\nscoop install sudo sudo scoop install 7zip git openssh --global scoop install aria2 curl grep sed less touch scoop install python ruby go perl Thats from the official page, what I really do when I log in Windows is 1\nscoop update * scoop cleanup * Homebrew Homebrew is a command-line package manager for macOS (or Linux 2) that allows installing software from the terminal. Brew provides a centralized repository of software packages that can be easily updated and installed. Again, from the official GitHub homepage\nFeatures, usage and installation instructions are summarised on the homepage. Terminology (e.g. the difference between a Cellar, Tap, Cask and so forth) is explained here.\nWhat Packages Are Available?\nType brew formulae for a list. Or visit formulae.brew.sh to browse packages online. More Documentation\nbrew help, man brew or check our documentation.\nBoth are awesome, try them and remember, I told you so™️\nIt would be great if you support the authors in a way, too.\nIn case you want to try more package managers there are Fink and MacPorts for macOS and Chokolatey for Windows.\nBonus 🥁 If you come from Windows there’s a free (not open-source) tool called Patch My PC Home Updater that installs a large list of apps with an easy user interface, what’s cool about it? That the apps are already hand-picked and that they are fully categorized! You can find very useful freeware tools there 😉 After installing some packages once with scoop install git gh 7zip nano nodejs-lts hugo ↩︎\nI dont recommend this, leave your Linux package manager alone 😃 ↩︎\n","date":1679423220,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679423220,"objectID":"86f5cad4c5277ce0dbe6719f915119c2","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/pkgman/","publishdate":"2023-03-21T21:27:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/pkgman/","section":"post","summary":"So hail to the package managers, we say, for keeping our software up-to-date each day!","tags":[],"title":"Package Managers - not the evil kind of PMs","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Are you tired of losing track of your bookmarks across multiple browsers?

Pre-commit hooks and pre-push hooks are scripts that run before a commit or a push, and they are used to perform automated tests, code quality checks, or other actions that help ensure the quality and correctness of your code. You can use husky or pre-commit if you need extra features or just production ready tools.\nSometimes, you may need to bypass these hooks and push your changes without running them. For example, if you’re in a hurry and you need to push a critical bug fix, or if you’re working in a team with strict code review policies and you need to push a work-in-progress commit for collaboration purposes.\nTo use it simply add the --no-verify flag to your git push command:\ngit push --no-verify This will push your changes to the remote repository without running the pre-commit or pre-push hooks.\nHowever, it’s important to note that using –no-verify should be done with caution, as it can potentially lead to lower code quality and a higher risk of introducing bugs or other issues into your codebase.

Barrier is available for many operating systems and can be downloaded from GitHub.\nA little bit of history:\nBarrier was created as a fork of Synergy due to certain limitations and issues that the developer of Barrier, Debauchee, experienced while using Synergy. Due to these limitations and issues, Debauchee decided to create a fork of Synergy, called Barrier, with the goal of addressing these issues and providing a more stable, customizable, and actively developed alternative to Synergy. Some of the features that Barrier added that Synergy didn’t have at the time like multi-monitor support, encryption, and improved cursor handling. Since then, Barrier has continued to be developed and maintained, with new features and improvements being added on a regular basis. It is also actively supported by its developer community, which aims to provide a stable, customizable and actively developed KVM solution for those who need it.\nI was an early user and even an Early Adopter of Synergy but was disappointed by the changes and bugs in version 3, then I switched to Barrier and never looked back.\nThe official Raspberry Pi website praised Barrier with a nice article and a video guide.\nThe configuration is easy and straightforward. You can find the instructions on how to install and configure Barrier on the GitHub page or watch the video.\nTip: You can use Scroll Lock to lock on a computer and don’t switch by accident to another, e.g. when playing a game.\n","date":1674230400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674230400,"objectID":"7818b3440a5d0a96355cd5c8d8afee4b","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/barrier/","publishdate":"2023-01-20T19:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/barrier/","section":"post","summary":"Barrier is an open-source KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) software that allows users to share their keyboard and mouse across multiple computers.

Tech Talk Linus Torvalds on git Git is alive\nDecember 12, 2022 Git is alive and actively developed Git Official site\nSO Survey 2021\nStack Overflow Developer Survey 2021 Over 90% of respondents use Git, suggesting that it is a fundamental tool to being a developer.\nSO Survey 2022\nStack Overflow Developer Survey 2022 No other technology is as widely used as Git. Especially among Professional Developers.\nQ: What are the primary version control systems you use?\nGlossary Working directory - repo the working directory is the folder on your system that you want to track. Where you develop your project. Everything git related is inside the .git folder. Serverless. Remote repository Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted elsewhere. You can have several of them, each one is either RO or RW for you. Git files Inside the working directory and beneath, you might find some git related files .gitattributes how to handle files .gitignore what to ignore .gitkeep keep an empty dir Tracked files Tracked files are the files in the working directory (repository) that Git manages. .\nThe Staging Area The intermediary between the working directory and the project history. Commit Commit is the process of adding any changes in tracked files. Git will keep track of all the changes in the Committed History. .\nCommit message The commit message is a summary and description of a commit action. Branches (develop, feature, master) A branch is a set of the repo tracked files. Git allows you to compare and merge branches. It can also be used to organize collaboration inside the repo, fix specific bugs, or create new features. .\nMerge Copy code changes from one branch to another. (not really git)\nFork You clone a public repo, make changes and contribute back with a PR. .\nPull/Merge request (PR) A PR is a request to the repository owner to merge your changes back into the original code base. git init Install git, then\ngit config --global user.name \u0026#34;John Smith\u0026#34; git config --global user.email john@example.com git config --global init.defaultBranch main Create a new folder for your project and add a file under version control\nmkdir -p ~/projects/git-test cd ~/projects/git-test git init nano new_file git add .

Initially, a novel 3-D model alignment method is introduced, which achieves accurate rotation estimation through the combination of two intuitive criteria, plane reflection symmetry and rectilinearity. After the pose normalization stage, a low-level descriptor extraction procedure follows, using three different types of descriptors, which have been proven to be effective. Then, a novel combination procedure of the above descriptors takes place, which achieves higher retrieval performance than each descriptor does separately. The paper provides also an in-depth study of the factors that can further improve the 3-D object retrieval accuracy. These include selection of the appropriate dissimilarity metric, feature selection/dimensionality reduction on the initial low-level descriptors, as well as manifold learning for re-ranking of the search results. Experiments performed on two 3-D model benchmark datasets confirm our assumption that future research in 3-D object retrieval should focus more on the efficient combination of low-level descriptors as well as on the selection of the best features and matching metrics, than on the investigation of the optimal 3-D object descriptor.","tags":["3D object retrieval","descriptor extraction","feature selection","manifold learning","rotation estimation"],"title":"Investigating the Effects of Multiple Factors towards more Accurate 3D Object Retrieval","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.Dutagaci","A.Godil","P.Daras","A.Axenopoulos","George Litos","S.Manolopoulou","K.Goto","T.Yanagimachi","Y.Kurita","S.Kawamura","T.Furuya","R.Ohbuchi","B.Gong","J.Liu","X.Tang"],"categories":["Computer Vision"],"content":"","date":1333238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1333238400,"objectID":"f267b29ce66d569e96e8fc5b70eb1b64","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/publication/shrec/","publishdate":"2012-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shrec/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we present the results of the 3D Shape Retrieval Contest 2011 (SHREC'11) track on generic shape retrieval.

Given the extend of the challenges involved in the automatic extraction of such descriptions, manually created metadata play a significant role, further strengthened by their deployment in training and evaluation tasks related to the automatic extraction of content descriptions. The different views taken by the two main approaches towards semantic content description, namely the Semantic Web and MPEG-7, as well as the traits particular to multimedia content due to the multiplicity of information levels involved, have resulted in a variety of image and video annotation tools, adopting varying description aspects.

The paper focuses on the investigation of an accurate D model alignment method, which is achieved by combining two intuitive criteria, the plane reflection symmetry and rectilinearity. After proper positioning in a coordinate system, a set of 2D images (multi-views) are automatically generated from the 3D object, by taking views from uniformly distributed viewpoints. For each image, a set of flip-invariant shape descriptors is extracted. Taking advantage of both the pose estimation of the 3D objects and the flip-invariance property of the extracted descriptors, a new matching scheme for fast computation of 3D object dissimilarity is introduced.
