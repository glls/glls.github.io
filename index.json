With its dual-pane interface and a range of features, MC simplifies file and directory operations, making it a beloved tool for both beginners and experienced users. As stated on it’s GitHub page, GNU Midnight Commander was conceived as a free clone of John Socha’s Norton Commander™. It also takes the best from more recent software with similar interfaces. Many years ago, we used file-managers like these, as “Norton Commander” in DOS, or the legendary DiskMaster2 in AmigaDOS, which is still alive in aminet!\nDual-Pane Interface for Seamless File Management One of the key strengths of Midnight Commander is its intuitive dual-pane layout. The two panes allow users to navigate through directories and manipulate files seamlessly. Whether you’re copying, moving, or deleting files, the dual-pane view enables quick and effortless operations. Moreover, MC provides a command-line prompt at the bottom, allowing users to execute commands directly without switching to a separate terminal window. This combination of a visual interface and command-line capabilities enhances productivity and workflow efficiency.\nFeature-Rich Functionality In addition to its exceptional file management capabilities, MC offers a wide range of features that further enhance its usefulness. It includes a built-in file viewer, which allows users to examine the contents of various file types without the need for external applications. Additionally, MC features a powerful text editor, enabling users to make quick modifications to files without leaving the application. The integrated FTP client functionality allows seamless transfers of files between local and remote systems, adding another layer of convenience for users who need to work with remote servers.\nYou can install MC in different systems or you can compile it from source (it’s written in C).\nMacOS brew install mc Ubuntu/Debian sudo apt install mc Archlinux sudo pacman -S mc Here’s a list of feature copied directly from GitHub:\nFeatures Some features are specific to the POSIX environment MC runs on, some are familiar to the users of similar software for other operating systems. The features include:\nBuilt in Virtual File System: manipulate remote file systems through the FTP and SFTP protocols or over secure shell, browse contents of tar, ar, rpm, zip, cpio, lha and rar archives just like local files.\nAlmost all operations work with the virtual file system, enabling you to do complex tasks, like viewing files in archives on an FTP server.\nMouse support on most terminal emulators for X Window System as well as on the Linux console.\nLearn Keys: GNU Midnight Commander may be configured at run time to support any kind of input keys for a given terminal, making its operation possible even on most weird terminals.\nText and hex editors are available for you to use (hex editor is a part of the viewer).\nHotlist allows you to keep a list of common visited locations, including remote sites and directories inside archives.\nCommand completion: By pressing Alt-Tab in any place where a filename or an executable are expected, GNU Midnight Commander will complete the name for you. If you press Alt-Tab for the second time, you get a list box with all possible completions.\nSubshell support: Run your commands by a real shell interpreter. GNU Midnight Commander interacts with bash, tcsh and zsh to provide you with all of the facilities available in your preferred shell.\nFind file command can search for the file contents.\nBackground operations allow you to copy or move files from any virtual file system while you do other tasks (i.e., you can do background FTP copies).\nFTP proxy is supported.\nLinux file recovery: If you are using Linux, you can recover deleted files from an ext2 or ext3 partition with the undelete file system. This is a low level file recovery function that can recover files deleted by any program on Linux.\nExternal panelization: You can run any arbitrary external command and GNU Midnight Commander will display the output generated as a file listing that can be manipulated as a regular directory.\nEmacs-like key bindings are used in all widgets.\nContext dependent actions (open, view, edit) are available.\nThe built-in file viewer, together with the context dependent actions is used to format man pages on the fly, coloring mail messages and more.\nThe built-in editor supports syntax highlighting and external actions, such as spell checking and formatting.\n","date":1685945887,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685945887,"objectID":"4cd8c9228b146b7addbbcef2c23463f1","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/mc/","publishdate":"2023-06-05T09:18:07.678+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/mc/","section":"post","summary":"In the world of command-line interfaces, Midnight Commander (MC) stands out as a powerful and versatile file manager that brings efficiency and convenience to text-based terminals","tags":["file manager","open source","productivity","tools"],"title":"MC: a commander like no other","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"scrcpy is an open-source tool developed by Genymobile, you can visit the Official GitHub and learn more.\nWord from the author: This application mirrors Android devices (video and audio) connected via USB or over TCP/IP, and allows to control the device with the keyboard and the mouse of the computer.

Two of the most popular package managers are Scoop for Windows and Homebrew for macOS.\nScoop Scoop is a command-line installer for Windows that allows users to easily install and manage software packages from the command line. As mentioned in the GitHub official page\nWhat does Scoop do?\nScoop installs programs from the command line with a minimal amount of friction. It:\nEliminates permission popup windows Hides GUI wizard-style installers Prevents PATH pollution from installing lots of programs Avoids unexpected side-effects from installing and uninstalling programs Finds and installs dependencies automatically Performs all the extra setup steps itself to get a working program Scoop is very scriptable, so you can run repeatable setups to get your environment just the way you like, e.g.:\nscoop install sudo sudo scoop install 7zip git openssh --global scoop install aria2 curl grep sed less touch scoop install python ruby go perl That’s from the official page, but, having installed some packages the first time 1 what I usually do each time I log in Windows is:\nscoop update * scoop cleanup * Homebrew Homebrew is a command-line package manager for macOS (or Linux 2) that allows installing software from the terminal. Brew provides a centralized repository of software packages that can be easily updated and installed. Again, from the official GitHub homepage\nFeatures, usage and installation instructions are summarised on the homepage. Terminology (e.g. the difference between a Cellar, Tap, Cask and so forth) is explained here.\nWhat Packages Are Available?\ntype brew formulae for a list. or visit formulae.brew.sh to browse packages online.

Pre-commit hooks and pre-push hooks are scripts that run before a commit or a push, and they are used to perform automated tests, code quality checks, or other actions that help ensure the quality and correctness of your code. You can use husky or pre-commit if you need extra features or just production ready tools.\nSometimes, you may need to bypass these hooks and push your changes without running them. For example, if you’re in a hurry and you need to push a critical bug fix, or if you’re working in a team with strict code review policies and you need to push a work-in-progress commit for collaboration purposes.\nTo use it simply add the --no-verify flag to your git push command:\ngit push --no-verify This will push your changes to the remote repository without running the pre-commit or pre-push hooks.\nHowever, it’s important to note that using –no-verify should be done with caution, as it can potentially lead to lower code quality and a higher risk of introducing bugs or other issues into your codebase. Therefore, it’s recommended to only use –no-verify when it’s absolutely necessary and always double-check your code before pushing it to a remote repository.\nYou can check the official Git Documentation.\nIf you want a refresher on general Git practices you can check my presentation.\n","date":1678272172,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678272172,"objectID":"20d1a761eaf28602b22658847a96f7c5","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/git-bypass/","publishdate":"2023-03-08T12:42:52+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/git-bypass/","section":"post","summary":"git push --no-verify is a command used to push your local changes to a remote repository without running pre-commit hooks or pre-push hooks.

Barrier is available for many operating systems and can be downloaded from GitHub.\nA little bit of history:\nBarrier was created as a fork of Synergy due to certain limitations and issues that the developer of Barrier, Debauchee, experienced while using Synergy. Due to these limitations and issues, Debauchee decided to create a fork of Synergy, called Barrier, with the goal of addressing these issues and providing a more stable, customizable, and actively developed alternative to Synergy. Some of the features that Barrier added that Synergy didn’t have at the time like multi-monitor support, encryption, and improved cursor handling. Since then, Barrier has continued to be developed and maintained, with new features and improvements being added on a regular basis. It is also actively supported by its developer community, which aims to provide a stable, customizable and actively developed KVM solution for those who need it.\nI was an early user and even an Early Adopter of Synergy but was disappointed by the changes and bugs in version 3, then I switched to Barrier and never looked back.\nThe official Raspberry Pi website praised Barrier with a nice article and a video guide.\nThe configuration is easy and straightforward. You can find the instructions on how to install and configure Barrier on the GitHub page or watch the video.\nTip: You can use Scroll Lock to lock on a computer and don’t switch by accident to another, e.g. when playing a game.\n","date":1674230400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674230400,"objectID":"7818b3440a5d0a96355cd5c8d8afee4b","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/post/barrier/","publishdate":"2023-01-20T19:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/barrier/","section":"post","summary":"Barrier is an open-source KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) software that allows users to share their keyboard and mouse across multiple computers.

Especially among Professional Developers.\nQ: What are the primary version control systems you use?\nGlossary Working directory - repo the working directory is the folder on your system that you want to track. Where you develop your project. Everything git related is inside the .git folder. Serverless. Remote repository Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted elsewhere. You can have several of them, each one is either RO or RW for you. Git files Inside the working directory and beneath, you might find some git related files .gitattributes how to handle files .gitignore what to ignore .gitkeep keep an empty dir Tracked files Tracked files are the files in the working directory (repository) that Git manages. .\nThe Staging Area The intermediary between the working directory and the project history. Commit Commit is the process of adding any changes in tracked files. Git will keep track of all the changes in the Committed History. .\nCommit message The commit message is a summary and description of a commit action. Branches (develop, feature, master) A branch is a set of the repo tracked files. Git allows you to compare and merge branches. It can also be used to organize collaboration inside the repo, fix specific bugs, or create new features. .\nMerge Copy code changes from one branch to another. (not really git)\nFork You clone a public repo, make changes and contribute back with a PR. .\nPull/Merge request (PR) A PR is a request to the repository owner to merge your changes back into the original code base. git init Install git, then\ngit config --global user.name \u0026#34;John Smith\u0026#34; git config --global user.email john@example.com git config --global init.defaultBranch main Create a new folder for your project and add a file under version control\nmkdir -p ~/projects/git-test cd ~/projects/git-test git init nano new_file git add .

Initially, a novel 3-D model alignment method is introduced, which achieves accurate rotation estimation through the combination of two intuitive criteria, plane reflection symmetry and rectilinearity. After the pose normalization stage, a low-level descriptor extraction procedure follows, using three different types of descriptors, which have been proven to be effective. Then, a novel combination procedure of the above descriptors takes place, which achieves higher retrieval performance than each descriptor does separately. The paper provides also an in-depth study of the factors that can further improve the 3-D object retrieval accuracy. These include selection of the appropriate dissimilarity metric, feature selection/dimensionality reduction on the initial low-level descriptors, as well as manifold learning for re-ranking of the search results. Experiments performed on two 3-D model benchmark datasets confirm our assumption that future research in 3-D object retrieval should focus more on the efficient combination of low-level descriptors as well as on the selection of the best features and matching metrics, than on the investigation of the optimal 3-D object descriptor.","tags":["3D object retrieval","descriptor extraction","feature selection","manifold learning","rotation estimation"],"title":"Investigating the Effects of Multiple Factors towards more Accurate 3D Object Retrieval","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.Dutagaci","A.Godil","P.Daras","A.Axenopoulos","George Litos","S.Manolopoulou","K.Goto","T.Yanagimachi","Y.Kurita","S.Kawamura","T.Furuya","R.Ohbuchi","B.Gong","J.Liu","X.Tang"],"categories":["Computer Vision"],"content":"","date":1333238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1333238400,"objectID":"f267b29ce66d569e96e8fc5b70eb1b64","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/publication/shrec/","publishdate":"2012-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shrec/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we present the results of the 3D Shape Retrieval Contest 2011 (SHREC'11) track on generic shape retrieval. The aim of this track is to evaluate the performance of 3D shape retrieval algorithms that can operate on arbitrary 3D models. The benchmark dataset consists of 1000 3D objects classified in 50 categories. The 3D models are mainly classified based on visual shape similarity and each class has equal number of models to reduce the possible bias in evaluation results.

Given the extend of the challenges involved in the automatic extraction of such descriptions, manually created metadata play a significant role, further strengthened by their deployment in training and evaluation tasks related to the automatic extraction of content descriptions. The different views taken by the two main approaches towards semantic content description, namely the Semantic Web and MPEG-7, as well as the traits particular to multimedia content due to the multiplicity of information levels involved, have resulted in a variety of image and video annotation tools, adopting varying description aspects. Aiming to provide a common framework of reference and furthermore to highlight open issues, especially with respect to the coverage and the interoperability of the produced metadata, in this chapter we present an overview of the state of the art in image and video annotation tools.","tags":["Annotation Tool","Image Annotation","Semantic Annotation","Video Annotation","Descriptive Metadata"],"title":"A Survey of Semantic Image and Video Annotation Tools","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.Axenopoulos","George Litos","P.Daras"],"categories":["3D Stereo Scene Analysis","Computer Vision"],"content":"","date":1302912000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1302912000,"objectID":"7b1f8ea2b2684e46eba300ab566746ce","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/publication/3d-model-retrieval/","publishdate":"2011-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/3d-model-retrieval/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a novel framework for 3D object retrieval is presented. The paper focuses on the investigation of an accurate D model alignment method, which is achieved by combining two intuitive criteria, the plane reflection symmetry and rectilinearity. After proper positioning in a coordinate system, a set of 2D images (multi-views) are automatically generated from the 3D object, by taking views from uniformly distributed viewpoints. For each image, a set of flip-invariant shape descriptors is extracted. Taking advantage of both the pose estimation of the 3D objects and the flip-invariance property of the extracted descriptors, a new matching scheme for fast computation of 3D object dissimilarity is introduced. Experiments conducted in SHREC 2009 benchmark show the superiority of the pose estimation method over similar approaches, as well as the efficiency of the new matching scheme.","tags":["pose estimation","alignment","3D object retrieval"],"title":"3D Model Retrieval using Accurate Pose Estimation and View-based Similarity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["George Litos","X.Zabulis","G.A.Triantafyllidis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1149120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1149120000,"objectID":"104fec222dde836ba72d5a6279065f25","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/publication/network-synchronization/","publishdate":"2006-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/network-synchronization/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a software-based system for the real-time synchronization of images captured by a low-cost camera framework is presented. It is most well suited for cases where special hardware cannot be utilized (e.g. remote or wireless applications) and when cost efficiency is critical. The proposed method utilizes messages to establish a consensus on the time of image acquisition and NTP synchronization of computer clocks. It also provides with an error signal, in case of failure of the synchronization. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm using a precise LED array system (1ms accuracy) proves the effectiveness of this method.","tags":["Cameras","Synchronization","Hardware","Application software","Production","Computer aided manufacturing","Real time systems","Computer errors","Light emitting diodes","Computer vision"],"title":"Synchronous Image Acquisition based on Network Synchronization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.Micheli-Tzanakou","G.A.Triantafyllidis","N.Thomos","G.Nikolakis","D.Tzovaras","George Litos","M.G.Strintzis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"c0e27f4e71554e4e7aaffa5691ed712f","permalink":"https://georgelitos.com/publication/mobile-tele-echography/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mobile-tele-echography/","section":"publication","summary":"Mobile interconnectivity and telemedicine are important issues for achieving effectiveness in health care, since medical information can be transmitted faster and physicians can make diagnoses and treatment decisions faster. In this context, the OTELO project (OTELO, 2001) aims to develop a fully integrated end-to-end mobile tele-echography system using an ultra light, remote-controlled robot, for population groups that are not served locally by medical experts. An expert located in the expert center will do the echographic diagnosis. There will be only a “non-sonographer” person in the isolated site and the wireless transmission system will be the only link between the two sites.

However, in some instances, a well-trained sonographer is unavailable to perform such echography. To cope with this issue, the Mobile Tele-Echography Using an Ultralight Robot (OTELO) project aims to develop a fully integrated end-to-end mobile tele-echography system using an ultralight remote-controlled robot for population groups that are not served locally by medical experts. This paper focuses on the user interface of the OTELO system, consisting of the following parts: an ultrasound video transmission system providing real-time images of the scanned area, an audio/video conference to communicate with the paramedical assistant and with the patient, and a virtual-reality environment, providing visual and haptic feedback to the expert, while capturing the expert's hand movements. These movements are reproduced by the robot at the patient site while holding the ultrasound probe against the patient skin. In addition, the user interface includes an image processing facility for enhancing the received images and the possibility to include them into a database.","tags":["User interfaces","Ultrasonic imaging","Mobile robots","Medical robotics","Videoconference","Biomedical imaging","Real time systems","Haptic interfaces","Feedback","Probes"],"title":"Mobile Tele-echography: User Interface Design","type":"publication"}]
