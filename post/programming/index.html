      <h2 id="computers">Computers</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computer</a> is an electronic device that can be programmed to carry out a wide range of tasks. It operates by performing sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Modern computers can store, retrieve, and process data, typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a more detailed breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>: Computers can store vast amounts of data and make it readily accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Processing</strong>: They can process data at incredibly high speeds, performing complex calculations and tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Output</strong>: After processing, computers can produce output that humans can interpret, such as visual display on a monitor, printed pages, audio, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Programmable</strong>: Perhaps most importantly, computers are programmable, meaning they can execute a set of instructions, or a program, to perform specific tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term &ldquo;computer&rdquo; was originally given to humans who performed numerical calculations using mechanical calculators. However, today&rsquo;s computers are electronic devices that accept data (input), process that data, produce output, and then store the results (storage).</p>

<li><strong>Variables</strong>: They allow you to store and manipulate data during program execution.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Languages include mechanisms to handle errors gracefully.</li>
<li><strong>Control Flow</strong>: You can create loops, conditionals, and other control structures.</li>
<li><strong>Functions/Methods</strong>: These allow you to encapsulate reusable code.</li>
<li><strong>Libraries</strong>: Languages come with built-in libraries or allow you to import external ones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An implementation of a programming language (such as a compiler or interpreter) translates human-readable code into machine-executable instructions.</li>
<li>The goal is to make the computer understand and execute the instructions provided by the programmer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Low-Level vs. High-Level</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low-level languages</strong> (closer to machine code) offer precise control but are harder to read.</li>
<li><strong>High-level languages</strong> (closer to human communication) are easier to program in and translate into machine code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstraction</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over time, programming languages have become more abstract, hiding hardware details for simplicity.</li>
